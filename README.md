about 20%(I think) of these projects are not finished. if you see something that isn't used in the code, that's for a later update. if something doesn't work, tell me.

some of these programs need their files. they are as follows: blue.png,red.png,rvbhighscore.txt for redvsblue.py, and responses.txt for learningtalk.py.

the more better programs are redvsblue(an actual playable game, with controls p, space, up and down arrow keys, and z), stocksim(a simulation of a stock price which gives you a chart when you enter "showplot"(without the quotes) for the input(but not for the first input), learningtalk.py(a ai chatbot, will copy you sometimes), lifegame.py(a conway's game of life simulation(search it up on google)), betaclick(an autoclicker which has customisable settings when you run it, and uses key "]" as the key you press when you want it to autoclick), and battleship.py(another game where you shoot at a ship by clicking on the screen, and blue is miss, and grey is hit).
